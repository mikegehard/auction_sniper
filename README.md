# Background
This project is an implementation of the AuctionSniper example from Growing Object Oriented Software, Guided by Tests book using CoffeeScript, Ruby and Websockets.

#Goal
To give an example of how I develop software using BDD and outside in development methodologies. It will show my "best practices" and give me a place to point aspiring software developers so we can have conversations around this style of development

#Prerequisites
Ruby 1.9.3
The Bundler gem
The latest version of Chrome or Firefox because the project uses websockets.
PhantomJS for running Jasmine tests headlessly. To install PhantomJS on OSX type `brew install phantomjs`.

#Following along
